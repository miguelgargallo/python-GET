To delete the first 188 lines and the lines 7903 to 8091 in all files inside the "pylar.data" folder, you can use the following code:

```
import os

# Set the directory path
directory = "pylar.data"

# Loop through all files in the directory
for filename in os.listdir(directory):
  # Open the file in read mode
  with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), "r") as file:
    # Read the first 188 lines and discard them
    for _ in range(188):
      file.readline()

    # Read the next 7902 lines
    for _ in range(7902):
      file.readline()

    # Read the next 189 lines and discard them
    for _ in range(189):
      file.readline()

    # Read the rest of the file
    data = file.read()

  # Open the file in write mode
  with open(os.path.join(directory, filename), "w") as file:
    # Overwrite the file with the remaining data
    file.write(data)
```

This code will read each file in the "pylar.data" folder, discard the first 188 lines and the lines 7903 to 8091, and then write the remaining data back to the file. Note that this code will overwrite the existing files, so make sure you have a backup of the original files before running it.
