Here is a python code that can clean all content inside the <head> tag from a file in the pylar.data folder and update the file with the cleaned content:

````
import os

# Path to the folder containing the files
folder_path = "pylar.data"

# Get a list of all files in the folder
file_list = os.listdir(folder_path)

# Loop through each file in the folder
for file_name in file_list:
    # Full path to the file
    file_path = os.path.join(folder_path, file_name)

    # Open the file in read mode
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        # Read the contents of the file
        file_content = file.read()

        # Clean the content inside the <head> tag
        cleaned_content = file_content.replace("<head>", "").replace("</head>", "")

    # Open the file in write mode
    with open(file_path, "w") as file:
        # Write the cleaned content to the file
        file.write(cleaned_content)
```

This code first gets a list of all files in the pylar.data folder. It then loops through each file in the folder and opens it in read mode. The contents of the file are read and cleaned by removing the <head> and </head> tags and their contents. Finally, the file is opened in write mode and the cleaned content is written to the file.

Note that this code assumes that all files in the pylar.data folder are HTML files with a <head> tag. You may need to modify the code to handle other types of files or file formats.
